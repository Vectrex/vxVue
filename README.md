A few basic Vue components styled with Tailwind CSS.

The official Tailwind CSS forms plugin is used to provide basic styling of the form components using the class strategy which allows the styling of non-form elements consistently.
An easy to configure color theming is applied.

Run
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm run dev
```
and navigate to the reported URL by Vite.
```
http://localhost:3000
```
